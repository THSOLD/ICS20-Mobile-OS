<h2 id=whatis>What are operating systems?</h2>
        <p id= "first">Operating systems are essentially what makes the device understand what to do with it's components</p>
<h2 id="whatmakes">Why are operating systems necessary?</h2>
        <p id= "second">Without them, the system cannot work. it will just be stuck in the motherboard's BIOS,<br> or nothingness if the motherboard dosen't have one(which virtually never happens).</p>

        <h2 id= "examplesheading">Examples of Mobile Operating Systems</h2>
        <p id= "examples">Some examples of mobile operating systems are: Android, IOS, BlackBerry OS, and Windows Phone (OS).</p>

        <h2 id= "differenceheading">What is the Difference Between Mobile Operating Systems and regular Operating systems?</h2>
        <p id= "difference">Aside from the fact that Mobile Operating systems are specifically made to work with mobile devices (less hardware intensive, they may be limited in supported hardware.<br>
        Otherwise, Mobile Operating Systems and regular Operating systems have only small differences really. They can work on any platform (given enough ram, a decent proccessor, and enough storage.), and can basically run your device well enough.<br>
            and here is where this gets complicated. <b>YOU</b> have to choose your OS, and this is where the small differences matter. If you want to type a lot, maybe Mac OS, or windows may be a better choice than Android, or IOS.
        What if you want to use apps like Instagram or Snapchat? Android and IOS would be a better choice.</p>
