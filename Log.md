# Things I have learnt
I have learned that input and output devices work worse with age, since their internal components get damaged by dust and overuse.
I have also learned that Graphics cards are actually 3 things in one! Graphics controller, Graphics Accelerator, and Graphics Board.

# Things I still want to learn
I still want to learn how the BIOS is flashed onto the motherboard and where it is stored on the motherboard,
and how to measure efficiency/speed of a motherboard, or if its measurable at all.
Motherboards are still a big mystery to me, and I do not think I got enough information about them from the website.
